Good vs Bad Prompts

On the second day of my summer training, I learned about the difference between good prompts and bad prompts.

What I Learned:

A bad prompt is vague, unclear, and does not provide enough instructions.

A good prompt is clear, specific, and guides the AI model to generate the desired output.

Difference Between Good & Bad Prompts  
| Type           | Example                                                                        | Result                                         |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------             |------------------------------------------------|
| ❌ Bad Prompt  | "Tell me something."                                                           | Output is random and not useful.              |
| ✅ Good Prompt | "Explain Artificial Intelligence in simple words with one real-life example."  | Output is clear, meaningful, and easy to understand. |
| ❌ Bad Prompt  | "Make an image."                                                               | AI generates any random image without context. |
| ✅ Good Prompt | "Create an image of a cat sitting on a chair while reading a book."            | AI generates a specific and relevant image.
