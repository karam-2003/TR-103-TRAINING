Introduction to Prompt Engineering

Today was the first day of my summer training in Prompt Engineering.

What I Learned:

I understood the basic concept of prompts. 

A prompt is the instruction or input we give to an AI model to get the desired output.

I learned why prompts are important. 

They guide the AI to generate helpful and relevant responses.

A well-written prompt improves the quality of the output. 

Poor prompts can lead to irrelevant or incorrect answers.
